            FitStudio was created with a single goal: to provide a shared professional space for wellness providers without the overhead and stress of running their own full facility. We believe licensed practitioners deserve a high-quality environment where they can focus purely on client care, recovery, and growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our studio combines modern design with functional rehab-friendly spaces — from padded open areas to sound-insulated therapy rooms. Whether you're a massage therapist, physical therapist, strength coach, or holistic practitioner, FitStudio offers a professional home base that respects both your work and your clients.
